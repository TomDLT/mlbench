# Distributed Machine Learning Benchmark
A public and reproducible collection of reference implementations and benchmark suite for distributed machine learning systems. Benchmark for large scale solvers, implemented on different software frameworks & systems. 

- For reproducibility and simplicity, we currently focus on standard **supervised ML**, namely classification and regression solvers. 
- We provide **reference implementations** for each algorithm, to make it easy to port to a new framework. 
- Our goal is to benchmark all/most currently relevant **distributed execution frameworks**. We welcome contributions of new frameworks in the benchmark suite
- We provide **precisely defined tasks** and datasets to have a fair and precise comparison of all algorithms and frameworks.
- Independently of all solver implementations, we provide universal **evaluation code** allowing to compare the result metrics of different solvers and frameworks.
- Our benchmark code is easy to run on the **public cloud**.
